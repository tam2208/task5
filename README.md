# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Objective
Perform EDA to extract insights from the Titanic dataset using Python and visualize relationships between features.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Visualizations
- Age Distribution Histogram
- Survival Count Plot
- Age by Passenger Class Boxplot
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot of Numerical Features


##  Summary of Findings
- Younger passengers (especially children) had higher survival rates.
- Females had a higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare and Passenger Class were important predictors of survival.
