Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective:
Explore the Titanic dataset to understand relationships between variables and identify patterns that may affect survival.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Findings:
- Age distribution shows a large number of passengers between ages 20â€“40.
- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers survived more often than those in lower classes.
- Positive correlation found between fare and survival.
- Pairplot and heatmap show multicollinearity between Pclass, Fare, and Survival.

Visualizations:
1. Age Distribution Histogram
2. Survival Count Plot
3. Boxplot: Age vs Pclass
4. Correlation Heatmap
5. Pairplot: Age, Fare, Pclass, Survived

Conclusion:
Passenger class, gender, and age were important factors in determining survival. The analysis provides clear evidence of social and economic patterns influencing survival outcomes.
